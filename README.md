# Expense-Tracker
Simple repo to practice react basics, working with components, state, events, rendering lists and conditional content. I'm not fetching data from a server, but using dummmy data for the initial dispay and adding new data only to the state. This project is from my udemy course with supplied css, I've only written the jsx.
