# Expense-Tracker
Simple repo to practice react basics, working with components, state, events, rendering lists and conditional content. I'm not fetching data from a server, but using a dummmy data for the initial dispay and adding the new data only to the state. This project is from my udemy course with supplied css, I've only written the jsx.
